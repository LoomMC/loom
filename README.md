# Loom
The all-in-one Minecraft Bedrock modding framework.

Loom is a mod framework similar to Forge/Fabric for the Java Edition. Loom strives to be a fast framework, as we are built with a C/C++ backend, which not only makes your mod compatible with the game, but lets it, run smoothly when the game gets it. Loom also is built with a Lua-based frontend API for the best user-functionality.

Examples of using the Loom API include:
- Accessing game functions that would be useful but difficult to get.
- An advanced API for rendering things on screen easily and efficiently.
- Having a built-in event system allowing for you to easily track when things happen.

## Platforms
We want to support every single device that can run Bedrock Edition, *except for consoles because of some limitations...*

- [x] Windows 10/11
- [ ] Linux (see [mcpelauncher](https://github.com/minecraft-linux/mcpelauncher-manifest))
- [ ] Mac (see [mcpelauncher](https://github.com/minecraft-linux/mcpelauncher-manifest))
- [ ] Android

## Contributing
If the Loom API does not support a specific function or structure, or you see an issue in the API, we encourage you to contribute. Check our [guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to see what to do.
